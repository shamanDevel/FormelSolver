# FormelSolver
A simple logic solver performing the DPLL and Resolution algorithm written in Java.

I wrote this tiny program in my first semester of the computer science bachelor to help me with the homework in discrete math.
It's not perfect, it is slow, it is buggy, but it works.

I provide this code "as is".
It only serves educational purpose to demonstrate how easily such a solver can be written.
It helped me a lot to learn and truly understand how DPLL and Resolution works.
